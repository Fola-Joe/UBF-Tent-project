                <h3>About the Ministry</h3>
                <p>The University Bible Fellowship Church (UBF) began as a
                    student movement in Korea in September of 1961, during a time
                    of national turmoil. Discouraged by the political and economic
                    situation of Korea after the civil war, students were wandering without
                    direction for their lives. At that time, God brought together Pastor Samuel
                    Lee and Missionary Sarah Barry. Samuel Lee was a Presbyterian pastor with
                    a passion for helping young people. Sarah Barry was a missionary sent by the
                    Board of World Missions of the Southern Presbyterian Church, USA, who came
                    seeking a way to help the war-devastated Korean people with the Bible.
                    Together they shared a common belief that the best way to help Korea and
                    the world was to plant faith in Christ and hope for the future in the hearts
                    of college students who could grow to be future leaders. Initially,
                    many students were drawn by English Bible study.
                    Through prayer and deep Bible study, the ministry quickly grew into
                    a grass roots movement of Christian students.</p>
